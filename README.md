# Stepup-bar-JSProject
This is a simple JavaScript Project Repo to show a progress bar with Next and Prev buttons and an image container. As the user clicks Next/Prev button, the progress on the bar changes along with image. 

This can be used in any website for example while filling a form.

Suitable Beginners Project to try HTML, CSS and JS hands-on.

Thanks.
